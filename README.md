# AcoraCMS_10.7.1_Improper_access_control
DDSN Interactive cm3 Acora CMS version 10.7.1 contains an improper access control vulnerability. An editor-privileged user can access sensitive configuration files by force browsing the “/Admin/file_manager/file_details.asp” endpoint and manipulating the “file” parameter. By referencing specific files (e.g., cm3.xml), the attacker can retrieve system administrator credentials, SMTP settings, database credentials, and other confidential information.
The exposure of this information can lead to full administrative access to the CMS, unauthorised access to email services, compromise of backend databases, lateral movement within the network, and long-term persistence by an attacker. This access control bypass poses a critical risk of account takeover, privilege escalation, and systemic compromise of the affected application and its associated infrastructure.
